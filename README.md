Data can be found in the data folder - this is the master data sheet for the project. When we clean up data, we will have R save it as separate data files in this folder that we can then use for our analysis. 

The Results folder will have the results of statistical tests - we do this by saving the output from tests as .csvs or .txt files into that folder in our R code (we will go over this together later)

The Plots folder will have the plots we make for the project, both clean and beautiful and preliminary. We put plots in this folder the same way we put results in the results folder - by writing R code to save the finished plots to these folders.
